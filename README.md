# Printed-Optics-Mounts
A project by Jacob Clarke of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Jaren Ashcraft of the University of Arizona.

Previous work has been done to mimic existing opto-mechanical components using common 3d printing plastics. This is done in an effort to mitigate the cost of optical mounts, and has the additional advantage of reducing wait time for the mounts to be shipped. We present an alternative method for creating high-rigidity mounting systems that can use traditional or 3d printed optical mounts, but keep entire systems aligned.
